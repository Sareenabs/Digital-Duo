### Project Description
[Trustora is a hyperlocal marketplace that connects homemakers and young innovators with nearby customers through a simple and trustworthy platform. It enables sellers to easily register and upload products, while customers can discover local items and place orders based on their location. By promoting local buying and selling, Trustora empowers small businesses and strengthens the local economy.]

### The Problem statement
[Many homemakers and young innovators possess valuable skills such as cooking, crafting, tailoring, and creating handmade products. However, despite their  talent, they struggle to turn their skills into a source of income.They face several major challenges:Lack of a proper online platform to sell their products,Limited technical knowledge to create and manage online stores,No marketing support to reach customers,Trust issues between buyers and sellers
Difficulty in finding local customers Because of these problems, many skilled individuals are unable to showcase their products or grow their small businesses.]
